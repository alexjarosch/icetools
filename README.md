# icetools
icetools provides a development environment for numerical ice flow models/simulations. Nonlinear rheology and Stokes approach are implemented. "Ready to use" programs/scripts are available based on different numerical libraries, from educational to HPC.

This project has been migrated from sourceforge.net to github on February 26th, 2019.

## Requirements

icetools requires a functioning installation of the [FEniCS project](https://fenicsproject.org/).
I recommend that you use the Docker container as described in the [FEniCS Install](https://fenicsproject.org/download/).

## Demo Run

I assume you have a Docker installation now and the FEniCS Docker image installed as well.
Now you can clone the icetools github repo with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexjarosch/icetools.git
```
